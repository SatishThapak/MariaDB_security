# Kerberos Setup & Implementation in Kafka, PostgreSQL, and Kerberos High Availability (HA)
For system administrators, DevOps engineers, or architects setting up secure environments.

# Domain Setup
We‚Äôre going to set up an MIT Kerberos domain with the following details (you can modify these to suit your environment):

# Realm: EXAMPLE.COM
# Primary KDC (main server): kdc1.example.com
# Secondary KDC (backup server): kdc2.example.com
# User account (principal): ubuntu
# Admin account (principal): ubuntu/admin

# üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites
Before installing the Kerberos server, ensure the following:

‚úÖ DNS is correctly configured for your domain. The Kerberos realm typically matches your domain name. In this example, we use EXAMPLE.COM

‚úÖ System time is synchronized across all hosts. Kerberos is time-sensitive. If a client‚Äôs clock differs from the server‚Äôs by more than 5 minutes, authentication will fail. To prevent this, all machines should use the same NTP (Network Time Protocol) server. Refer to the NTP section for configuration details.
